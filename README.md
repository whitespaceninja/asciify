# asciify

Adds an 'Asciify' selection for your right click image context menu. Clicking Asciify will print out an ascii version of that image to the background console. Future versions will print it out somewhere better :)

To get to the background console, go to chrome://extensions and find the Asciify extension. Click the 'Inspect views: background.html' link and open up dev tools. Make the console window really big and shrink the hell out of the text by pressing 'Command -' a million times.
